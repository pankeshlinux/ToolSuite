ToolSuite
=========

This is a ToolSuite  for developing Internet of Things(IoT) applications. The IoT application contains various sensors, 
actuators, storages, end-user applications, processing components. We are attempting to integrate all these heterogeneous
components into this toolsuite. This toolsuite covers application development stages such as design, implementation,
deployment, and evolution. It offers tool supports in order to ease of application development for the developers.


This toolkit is in pre-alphas stage. Me and Dimitris are developing IoT applications on real middleware and real 
devices. We identify bugs and fix those bugs. In order to improve this work, your contributions/suggestions are 
most welcomed. In order to get theoritical/programming understanding please contact me or Dimitris Soukaras 
or refer my publications (Google profile : Pankesh Patel).
